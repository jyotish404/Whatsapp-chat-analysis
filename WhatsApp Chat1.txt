09/06/2021, 7:18 pm - Mehwish: List down all the major tasks and subtasks which you need to complete
the product by each member and an achievable time frame for each one. It will give you a
road map to follow for the future. It may change with the progress of your project (agile
environment). However, you need to have a tentative plan for your project. I highly
recommend maintaining a table.
